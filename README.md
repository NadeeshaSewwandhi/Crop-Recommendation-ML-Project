# Crop-recommendation-ML-Project

Project Introduction :

The Crop Recommendation System is a Flask-based machine learning web application that predicts the most suitable crop to cultivate based on soil nutrients and environmental conditions. By entering values for Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, Temperature, Humidity, pH, and Rainfall, users receive accurate recommendations on which crop is best suited for cultivation in that environment.

Project Background :

Agriculture is the backbone of many economies; yet, farmers often face challenges in selecting the right crop for their specific soil and climate conditions. This project was developed as part of my learning journey in machine learning and web development to demonstrate how data-driven models can support sustainable farming. It combines data science concepts with a user-friendly web interface to make predictive insights accessible.

Features of this project :

1. Real-time crop prediction based on soil and weather parameters
2. Flask-based web interface with a simple and clean design
3. End-to-end ML pipeline: data preprocessing → training → scaling → prediction → deployment
4. Responsive User Interface with dynamic background images
5. User-friendly results display with tailored recommendations

Technologies Used :

Programming Language: Python 3.11
Frameworks: Flask, Bootstrap 5
Libraries: scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, Pickle
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Tools: Git/GitHub for version control
