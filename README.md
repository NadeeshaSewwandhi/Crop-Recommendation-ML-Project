# Crop-recommendation-ML-Project
The Crop Recommendation System is a machine learningâ€“based web application designed to help farmers and agricultural planners identify the most suitable crop to cultivate in a given region. By analyzing key environmental and soil parameters such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, temperature, humidity, pH level, and rainfall, the system predicts the best crop that can thrive under those specific conditions.

This project integrates a trained Random Forest Classifier with a Flask web interface, allowing users to input values and instantly receive accurate crop recommendations.
